# Write a program that does the following in order:  
# 1. Asks the user to enter a number “x” 
# 2. Asks the user to enter a number “y”  
# 3. Prints out number “x”, raised to the power “y”. 
# 4. Prints out the log (base 2) of “x”. 

# x = int(input("Enter to number x: "))
# y = int(input("Enter to number y: "))

# print(x ** y)
# print(np.log2(x))

# 2. Now write a line that sets a variable named x to 5.
# 3. Now write a line that sets a variable named y to 8.
# 4. Add variables x and y, and save the result to a variable named z.
# 5. Now save the result of this command: numpy.log2(z) to a variable named a.

# x = 5
# y = 8
# z = x + y
# a = np.log2(z)
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
# print(a)
